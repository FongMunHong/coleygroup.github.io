# Coley Research Group Website

This is the website of the Coley Research group at MIT. It is modified on top of a Jekyll template developed by the Allan Lab.

## Contributor Guide

Any Coley Group members are free to make changes and additions to the website through this repo, pending approval by Kevin, Kento, or Connor. The following guide should hopefully make this process as painless as possible.

### Local Deployment

To preview your changes before making a pull request, it is highly encouraged to locally deploy the website on your machine. First, install Jekyll if you have not done so, following [the official guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements) corresponding to your OS. 

Next, clone this repo to your local machine:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/coleygroup/coley.mit.edu.git
```

In your newly created folder, simply run the following to serve the website at `http://localhost:4000`.
```bash
$ jekyll serve
```
